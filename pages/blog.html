            <h3>Blog Post 1</h3>
              <article>
                <p>This week I practiced some css and worked on my personal site.<br>I started working on it in bootstrap and made the mistake of using bootstrap 4.0 with 3.3 syntax. Funny thing about that is, it doesnt work.</p>
                <p> Also deciding how to style the page was difficult, as I am not very creative. Eventually I just decided to throw the elements on the page and make it look "not ugly"</p>
                <p>tldr: I learned how to make a branch in github, and confirmed my lack of creativity in website design.</p>

              <h3>Trouble With Arrays [3.6.18]</h3>
                <article>
                  <p>Last week I worked on some challenges involving arrays, and looping through them.<br/> It was tricky work, but I managed to find some very helpful array methods to make the tasks a bit easier.</p>
                  <p>Notably the filter method and the map methods were extremely useful to me. <br/> I also managed to use the filter method to create an Array prototype called .diff().<br/> The .dif() prototype finds the difference between two arrays, and I was able to use this to solve multiple problems. </p>
